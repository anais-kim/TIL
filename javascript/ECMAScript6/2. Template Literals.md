## 1-2. Template Literals
With Template Literals, we can easily build strings using back-ticks(``) and ${expression}.
```javascript
const student = {
  name: 'Richard Kalehoff',
  guardian: 'Mr. Kalehoff'
};

const teacher = {
  name: 'Mrs. Wilson',
  room: 'N231'
}

let message = `${student.name} please see ${teacher.name} in ${teacher.room} to pick up your report card.`;
```

Also, making multi-line stings could be much easier.
```javascript
// before ES6
var note = teacher.name + ',\n\n' +
    'Please excuse ' + student.name + '.\n' +
    'He is recovering from the flu.\n\n' +
    'Thank you,\n' +
    student.guardian;    
```
```javascript
// after ES6
var note = `${teacher.name},

    Please execute ${student.name}.
    He is recovering from the flu.
    
    Thank you,
    ${student.guardian};`;
```
